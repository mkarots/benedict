**Estimated Work**: 30-40 implementation items across 4 phases

---

## 🎯 Critical Path to Launch

### Phase 1: Legal & Safety (Week 1)
**Blockers that prevent going public**

```
1. Create LICENSE file (MIT)
2. Scan git history for secrets
3. Remove personal info (done — examples use example-org / @alice; #49)
4. Create SECURITY.md
5. Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

### Phase 2: Community (Week 2)
**Essential for external contributors**

```
6. Create CONTRIBUTING.md
7. Create GitHub issue templates (bug, feature)
8. Create PR template
9. Update README (badges, links, polish)
10. Set up basic test framework
```

### Phase 3: Quality (Week 3-4)
**Build confidence for users**

```
11. Write core unit tests (>50% coverage)
12. Set up CI workflow (lint, test, type check)
13. Add pre-commit hooks
14. Configure Dependabot
15. Set up branch protection
```

### Phase 4: Launch Prep (Week 5+)
**Polish for promotion**

```
16. Comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
17. Release workflow for PyPI
18. Set up GitHub Discussions
19. Prepare announcement materials
20. Final documentation review
```

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| Secrets in git history | 🔴 High | 🟡 Low | Thorough scan; appears clean |
| No tests | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Write tests before promotion |
| Personal info exposure | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 None in examples | Done 2026-08-29; real GitHub URLs stay |
| License compliance | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low | MIT claimed; just add file |
| Name conflicts | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low | "Benedict" appears available |

**Overall Risk**: MODERATE - Manageable with systematic execution

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can we skip tests for the initial release?**  
A: Not recommended. Even basic tests (30-40% coverage) build confidence. Users are less likely to adopt untested code.

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: Minimum 4 hours for basic open source. 2-3 weeks for quality launch. No need to estimate calendar time - focus on completing the critical path.

**Q: Do we need to wait for 100% test coverage?**  
A: No. Launch at 50-60%, improve to 80%+ over first 3 months.

**Q: Should we use TestPyPI first?**  
A: Yes! Always test package publication on TestPyPI before real PyPI.

**Q: What if someone reports a security vulnerability?**  
A: SECURITY.md will guide them to private disclosure. Respond within 24-48 hours. Fix before public disclosure.

**Q: Do we need a trademark?**  
A: Not initially. "Benedict" appears available. Consider later if project grows.
