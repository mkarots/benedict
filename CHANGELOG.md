# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- **MCP server**: Cursor, Claude Code, and other MCP clients can query onboarded Benedict projects over stdio. Tools: `list_projects`, `get_repository_summary`, `search_code`, `get_recent_actions`, `ask_benedict`. Entry point: `benedict-mcp` / `python -m benedict.mcp`. See [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-18

### Removed
- **Method subsystem**: Removed `.benedict.method.yaml` reading, writing, Slack create-method command, classifier method tools, prompt rhetoric, and onboard auto-create. The YAML file was not consumed as methodology (rules were never enforced), and the surrounding machinery duplicated create/read/update paths. Metadata tools and repo Q&A are unchanged.

## [0.3.20] - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- **README**: Rewrote the project README to match the current system. It now describes workspaces, method and metadata files, architect channel, semantic indexing, GitHub CLI, configuration, and the real command surface. Removed stale v0 stub checklists, broken root doc links, and the claim that GitHub API integration was the next unstarted milestone without mentioning what already shipped.

### Fixed
- Package `__version__` in `src/benedict/__init__.py` now matches `pyproject.toml`.

## [0.3.19] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Design analysis**: Added `plans/PROMPT_FIRST_VS_TOOLS.md` and `plans/PROMPT_FIRST_VS_TOOLS.html` describing how Benedict uses LLM tools today and whether a prompt-first approach would be a better default.

## [0.3.18] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **GitHub CLI tool (`run_github`)**: Benedict can run `gh` in the onboarded workspace repository during conversations. The model supplies argv; code locks the binary to `gh`, cwd to the repo, timeout, and output size. Results are fed back through a short tool loop so the model can interpret them instead of dumping raw CLI output to Slack. Mutating GitHub (create/merge/close/comment) is left to the prompt (ask first). Requires `gh` installed and authenticated on the host.

## [0.3.17] - 2026-04-28

### Removed
- **`FileWatcherDetector`**: Removed unused mtime-based change detector. It was wired into the `create_repo_change_detector` factory under `detector_type="file_watcher"` but never instantiated at runtime — the `"auto"` branch always returned `GitChangeDetector`. Deleted `src/benedict/repo_change_detector/file_watcher_detector.py`, removed exports from `repo_change_detector/__init__.py`, simplified the factory to only support `"git"`, and updated `main.py` to pass `detector_type="git"` explicitly.

### Changed
- Updated `docs/FILE_AND_GIT_WATCHING.md` and `plans/ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect that `GitChangeDetector` is now the only `RepoChangeDetector` implementation.

## [0.3.16] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Documentation**: Added `docs/FILE_AND_GIT_WATCHING.md` describing how file watching, git watching, and change detection work in Benedict.

## [0.3.15] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Disabled documentation file detection**: The automatic detection and notification of new .md files has been disabled as it was making Slack channels too noisy. Commit detection and notifications remain active.

## [0.3.14] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fixes in Slack Formatter:**
  - Fixed placeholder collision vulnerability (Bug #1): Replaced simple numeric placeholders with UUID-based placeholders to prevent collisions with actual code content
  - Fixed infinite loop in `split_message()` (Bug #5): Added progress check and maximum iteration limit to prevent hangs
  - Fixed unsafe string replacement (Bug #3): Replaced `str.replace()` with position-based removal to avoid substring collisions
  - Fixed unclosed code blocks in truncation (Bug #6): Added code block balance verification before truncating
  - Fixed heading detection in code blocks (Bug #4): Headings inside code blocks are now correctly excluded from section splitting
  - Fixed language identifier regex (Bug #2): Now supports language identifiers with hyphens, dots, plus signs, and hash (e.g., `python-3`, `c++`, `c#`, `tsx.js`)
  - Fixed Mermaid/code block overlap (Bug #7): Mermaid blocks are now excluded from code block extraction using negative lookahead
  - Fixed field truncation issue (Bug #8): Field chunks are now used directly instead of being truncated again
- **Edge Case Improvements:**
  - Added handling for very long single-line code blocks: splits at whitespace/punctuation boundaries
  - Added URL length validation for Mermaid rendering: prevents extremely long URLs (>2000 chars)
- **Code Quality:**
  - Extracted magic numbers to named constants: `PARAGRAPH_SEARCH_WINDOW`, `NEWLINE_SEARCH_WINDOW`, `TRUNCATION_THRESHOLD_RATIO`, `CODE_BLOCK_BUFFER`, `MAX_ITERATIONS_SPLIT`
  - Improved error handling and logging throughout the formatter

- Fixed duplicate responses when @mentioning the bot (message handler now skips messages with bot mentions)

## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- Repository source paths are now configurable via `BENEDICT_REPO_SOURCE_DIRS` environment variable
- Format: comma-separated paths, e.g., `BENEDICT_REPO_SOURCE_DIRS=/Users/name/Projects,/opt/repos`

- Automatic detection of thread context to understand when users are talking to Benedict

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- Removed manual `@agent index slack history` command - indexing now happens automatically in the background

## [0.2.8] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
