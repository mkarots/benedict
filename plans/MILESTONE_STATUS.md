## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Core Infrastructure (v0)
- Slack bot with Socket Mode
- Channel → Repository mapping
- Onboard and Status commands
- State persistence (JSON)
- Thread-based conversations
- Error handling

#### LLM Integration (M1)
- LLM protocol with Claude implementation
- Local repository reader
- Context building from repository files
- Composition root pattern
- Dependency injection

#### Enhanced Features (Beyond Original Plans)
- **Conversation Management**: Full conversation history tracking per thread
- **Semantic Search**: ChromaDB + sentence-transformers for intelligent file selection
- **Repository Pattern**: ConversationRepository for persistence abstraction
- **Protocol-Based Design**: All components use protocols for testability
- **Mock Implementations**: Complete test doubles for all protocols
- **Metadata System**: `.metadata.benedict` files providing structured directory summaries with file purposes, key functions, and classes
- **Workspace Management**: Per-channel isolated workspaces with symlink/copy support for repository access
- **Change Detection**: Git-based incremental indexing to only reindex changed files
- **Batched chunk deletes**: Incremental updates remove old Chroma chunks with `file_path $in` batches, not one `get` per file
- **Metadata-Enhanced Search**: Semantic search boosted by directory metadata for better relevance
- **Update Index Command**: Manual reindexing capability via Slack commands

### 📊 Implementation Statistics

**Files Created:**
- 30+ Python files (protocols + implementations + mocks + metadata system + workspace management)
- 5+ Documentation files (README, ARCHITECTURE, CLEANUP_SUMMARY, MILESTONE_STATUS, CHANGELOG)
- 1 Makefile (with dev environment automation)
- 1 pyproject.toml (modern Python packaging)

**Code Organization:**
- Protocols: 5+ (LLM, RepoReader, SemanticIndexer, ConversationRepository, RepoChangeDetector)
- Implementations: 12+ (Claude, LocalRepoReader, WorkspaceRepoReader, ChromaDB, JSON, GitChangeDetector, etc.)
- Mocks: 5+ (for testing)
- Core: 3 (main.py, agent.py, slack_app.py)
- Utilities: 2+ (context.py, slack_formatter.py)
- Metadata: 3+ (metadata_generator.py, metadata_reader.py, content_handlers.py)
- Workspace: 2+ (workspace_manager.py, action_logger.py)

**Architecture:**
- ✅ SOLID principles applied
- ✅ Root composition pattern
- ✅ Dependency injection throughout
- ✅ Protocol-based abstractions
- ✅ Graceful degradation (works without optional components)

### 🎯 Milestone Completion Summary
